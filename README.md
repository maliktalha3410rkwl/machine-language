# Laptop Price Prediction ‚Äì Data Analysis and Modeling

This project is a complete data science pipeline for analyzing laptop pricing data and building a machine learning model to predict laptop prices. It covers data collection, cleaning, exploratory analysis, modeling, and evaluation using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## üìÅ Project Structure

### 1. **Importing Libraries**
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries:
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib` for visualization
- `sklearn` for machine learning and evaluation
- `pickle` for saving the trained model

### 2. **Data Collection**
A custom `DataCollector` class is defined to:
- Load data from a CSV file (`laptops.csv`)
- Print basic information about the dataset
- Display the first few rows

### 3. **Data Understanding**
Another class, `DataUnderstanding`, is used to:
- Provide an overview of the data (shape, types, missing values, and descriptive stats)
- Show unique values for selected columns, including the target column `Final Price`

### 4. **Next Steps**
The later parts of the notebook likely include:
- Feature engineering
- Model training (e.g., Support Vector Classifier)
- Accuracy evaluation
- Model serialization with `pickle`
### Feature Engineering, Model Training, Evaluation, and Serialization (Detailed Description)

In the **feature engineering** phase, the raw dataset is transformed into a format suitable for machine learning models. This typically includes converting categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding, addressing missing values, and creating new features that might improve model performance.

Following this, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()` from the Scikit-learn library. This split ensures that the model can be trained on one subset of data and evaluated on a separate, unseen portion to measure how well it generalizes.

The **model training** is conducted using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC), a supervised learning algorithm that identifies the optimal hyperplane for classifying data points. SVC is particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.

After training, the model's performance is assessed using `accuracy_score`, which calculates the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. This helps in understanding how accurate the model is on unseen data.

Finally, the trained model is **serialized using the `pickle` module**, allowing it to be saved as a `.pkl` file. Serialization enables reusing the model in future applications or deployments without retraining.
